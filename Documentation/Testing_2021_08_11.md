# Oh man was I surprised
I recently tested the A02 BatteryBoost boards and learned something very important when it comes to designing switch mode power supplies.

Switch Current is not the same thing as Output Current of the Power Supply you are designing.

I was expecting to get 1 Amp out of the board from the input voltage supply. I was actually getting around 120 mA at around 12 V when the converter IC is set to 24 V.

The board is experiencing significant voltage derating when loaded due to what I believe is the current limiting function of the converter IC. If the input voltage is raised, the output voltage will go up some, and if the load is decreased this will also raise the output voltage.  

After some searching around the internet, I came across some application notes that might have some detailed information.

For further information refer to Application Note AN920A/D and AN954/D.

I should try and calculate the maximum current that can be drawn at 24 Volts before derating happens.
