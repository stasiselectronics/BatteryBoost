# Battery Boost Module
<h3>3.7 V input, 5V-24V output</h3>

This respository contains the source files for a boost circuit designed to boost the voltage from a lithium battery to anywhere between 5 and 24 Volts.

The module includes a battery management system to help make recharging as easy as plugging in the microUSB cable.

## Project Status

I have written an article on Hackster to explain some of the lessons learned while working on this design.

I still have some testing to do and write about, so stay tuned for that!

I also intend on creating a documentation companion site hosted on this repo's github page.
