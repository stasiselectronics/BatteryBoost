# Battery Boost Module
<h3>3.7 V input, 5V-24V output at 1 Amp (24 Watts Max)</h3>
At least, that's the goal.

This respository contains the source files for a boost circuit designed to provide max 24V and minimum 5V at 1.5 Amps.

It is a modification of my fume extractor PCB, which I used as a basis for the design.

## KiCAD

This board has been designed in KiCAD, the wonderful open-source Electronics CAD software!

## Project Status

This project is very early in development, so please consider this design as unverified.

Revision A01 has been sent out for fabrication May 16, 2021. Delivery is expected Week 22-23 2021.

The tag for this release has all the design files just as they were when the fabrication output files were generated.

### Future Testing

Once the boards come in, it will need to be tested to verify functionality and limits.
- Can it boost lithium battery voltages (3.2v:4.7v) to 5v:24v?
- Can it deliver 1 Amp output at 24v?
- Can it charge a lithium battery at 1 Amp?
- Does it get too hot?
- How much quiescient current does the board consume?
