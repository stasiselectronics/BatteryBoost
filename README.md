# Battery Boost Module
<h3>3.7 V input, 5V-24V output at 1.5 Amps</h3>
At least, that's the goal.

This respository contains the source files for a boost circuit designed to provide max 24V and minimum 5V at 1.5 Amps.

It is a modification of my fume extractor PCB, which I used as a basis for the design.
